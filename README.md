# Style Transfer App

## Introduction
A small application used to perform **style transfer**. Style transfer is a computer vision technique that allows us to recompose the content of an image in the style of another. If youâ€™ve ever imagined what a photo might look like if it were painted by a famous artist, then style transfer is the computer vision technique that turns this into a reality.
